Preliminary knowledge Before introducing the concept of ROC, we need to firstly know some basics. Here, take a binary classifier as an example(logistic regression, random forest etc.), there are totally four situations when doing prediction.
 TP(true positive): precdict a positive sample as positive FP(false positive): predict a negative sample as positive TN(true negative): predict a negative sample as negative FN(false negative): predict a positive sample as negative  Now we let TP, FP, TN, FN represent the number of samples in corresponding situation and let 1 be positive label and 0 be negative label, then we can get the following table:</description>
